The next release will include:

- NTLM v2 



later, (not in order) 

- A little network sniffer module to automaticaly catch on the fly every hashes. 
- A BSD style password cracker to check your system passwords if u are already using MD5 for this purpose.
Don't expect this mode to run as fast as the simple one since the crypt() C function consum a lot of time in many calculations before giving a result precisely to prevent this kind of bruteforce attack. Anyway, it should be fast enough to detect weak passwords. 

- A simple dictionnary based attack mode, no word permutation, a simple checklist like a plaintext dictionnary (at least in a first time).

- A man page
