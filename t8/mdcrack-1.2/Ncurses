Ncurses is not present in some systems by default, if u don't have it or just don't wish it,  desactivate it in the Makefile.
Comment the two lines concerning Ncurses

#NCURSES=-DNCURSES 

#LDFLAGS=-lncurses

If u are about to use Ncurses with a poorly featured terminal/non color terminal, u may do better by recompiling without ncurses otherwise the resulting screen might be somewhat weird.
The real gain with the library merely reside in the presentation layer (color/animation/screen layout).
However it's as u want, i prefer with.
