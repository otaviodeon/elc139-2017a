Solaris and all others big endian based computers need user to specify the keyword ISBIG_ENDIAN at compilation time.
To do so just type :

#make big install
or
#install.sh and choose "big" when asked for it.

This will create a binary for big endian and then, will automatically install it in /usr/sbin/mdcrack.
This was successfully tested on Solaris 2.5.6 but should be ok the same way with AIX, Alfa ...

Enjoy.
